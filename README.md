# Wundernn Challenge

the directory `competition_package` contains my approaches to the [market state prediction challenge](https://wundernn.io/wunder_challenge) by [wunder fund](https://wunderfund.io/en). i ended up `#22` on the [leaderboard](https://wundernn.io/wunder_challenge/finals) with a final `R^2 score` of `0.3894`. 

> [!TIP]
> would not recommend to go through my approaches through the `competition_package` directory; it's very messy. instead read my notes [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19BVc79P92-hB2zdB95255Ikx2eq0H8Kg?usp=drive_link).
